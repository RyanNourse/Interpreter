# Interpreter
Created a simple interpreter that reads in information from a file. That is then used to create a JavaFx graphic based on the data that was stored in the registers created. Registers are created based on what the file requests. 
There are 23 commands "globalfloat" "jumpif", "jump", "print", "label", "time", "float", "bool", "=", "&&", "||", "!", ">", ">=", "==", "+", "-", "*", "/", "%", "function", "callfunction", "endfunction". All them based on how assembly would interpret the functionality of each command. 

Terminal run information of what is stored and when:
